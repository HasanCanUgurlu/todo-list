This is a full-stack JavaScript web application. I used:

- Express.js, EJS, and body-parser. EJS makes easy when you write HTML in JavaScript, and body-parser helps with requests from body.
- MongoDB for backend. I hooked mongoose to my App.js so I can store data in my MongoDB server.
- lodash for being able to create multiple list in URL bar.
